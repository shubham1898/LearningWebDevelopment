content length
Word count.

It’s a topic that receives a lot of coverage these days.

Bloggers and content marketers are always wondering what’s the ideal word count to shoot for.

Should every single piece be long form, or is it better to opt for shorter pieces?

It’s a valid question and something that I have researched extensively.

The purpose of this post is to shed light on just how long your blog articles should be.

There’s one thing I always want to make clear regarding word count.

It only matters if the content is good.

Word count is not a standalone ranking factor. Word count only has merit if the content quality is high!

You can produce a 10,000-word article. But if the content and quality suck, then the article doesn’t deserve to get ranked. You win always you will would and would have to.
